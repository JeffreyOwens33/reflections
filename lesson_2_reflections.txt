git init initializes a repository with no commits
git init turns a folder into a git repository which means that you can start tracking files and changes to those files
 Staging area is the preparation area for files to be committed. Only files in this area are going to be included in the commit executed next time. It helps to divide changes in the working directory into several commits, each of which consists of a group of changes that represent a logical change to the relevant files.
you can use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change by  First add files that are related to the first logical change you want to commit, and after making it sure you have staged all the files, make a commit. Next you stage other files that are related to the second logical change you want to commit, and so on.
